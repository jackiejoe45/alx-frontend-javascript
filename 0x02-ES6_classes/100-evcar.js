/*
Import Car from 10-car.js.

Implement a class named EVCar that extends the Car class:

Constructor attributes:
brand (String)
motor (String)
color (String)
range (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
For privacy reasons, when cloneCar is called on a EVCar object, the object returned should be an instance of Car instead of EVCar.
*/
import Car from './10-car';

export default class EVCar extends Car {
  constructor(brand, motor, color, range) {
    // call constructor of super class (Building)
    super(brand, motor, color);

    // Create objs
    this._range = range;
  }

  // Methods

  cloneCar() {
    const NewObj = this.constructor[Symbol.species] || this.constructor;
    const clone = new NewObj();
    return clone;
  }
}
